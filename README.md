# students-app
Simple app which shows student data

We need node, mysql, express to run this app
Install these libraries:

        npm install express mysql cors --save

Go to the db.config.js file and make sure it matches your mysql credentials

In the root folder, run this command:

        node server

On a different terminal, run this command in the client-side folder:

        npm start
        
It should be working now
